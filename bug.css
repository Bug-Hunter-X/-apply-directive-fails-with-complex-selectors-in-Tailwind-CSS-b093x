This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that has a complex selector, such as a pseudo-class or a media query.  The `@apply` directive will not correctly apply the styles defined in the referenced class. For example:

```css
/* styles.css */
.hover\:bg-red-500 { @apply bg-red-500; }
```

```html
<button class="hover\:bg-red-500">Hover me</button>
```

This code will not correctly change the background color to red on hover.
