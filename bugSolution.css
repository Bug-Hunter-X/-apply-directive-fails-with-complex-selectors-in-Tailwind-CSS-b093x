The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with complex selectors. Instead, define the styles directly in the class that uses the complex selector. For example:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
button:hover {  
  @apply bg-red-500; 
}
```

This will correctly change the background color to red on hover.  Alternatively, for more complex scenarios, consider using utility-first approach instead of relying solely on `@apply` for complex selectors.
